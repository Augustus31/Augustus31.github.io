      <h1><a href="https://cw3e.ucsd.edu/" target = "_blank">What is CW3E?</a></h1>
      <p class="w3-padding-32">CW3E is an acronym for the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes, an arm of Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, CA. It is a body with a particular focus on the analysis and prediction of weather patterns, especially precipitation, in the western United States and California in particular. Because California's mediterranean climate features very distinct wet and dry seasons, and because most of the state's precipitation comes from a handful of atmospheric river (AR) events in the winter, the state is highly susceptible to droughts in bad years or floods in periods of high AR activity. Therefore, accurate forecasting is tremendously important.
      </p>

      <h1>The EnsDL Workflow</h1>
      <p class="w3-padding-32">One major project CW3E is currently working on is EnsDL, a Deep Learning-based prediction algorithm that builds on a pre-existing major model ensemble. While ensemble forecasts are generally accurate, they are not tuned for the particular climatic and topographic conditions in the western U.S; thus, the EnsDL algorithm takes ensemble outputs and feeds them into another neural network, which makes an adjustment to improve the accuracy of the forecast. The output is a gamma distribution of forecasted potential precipitation, which can then be parsed by a CDF function into a mean forecast and various percentile forecasts.  
      </p>

      <h1>My Contribution</h1>
      <p class="w3-padding-32">I was initially accepted as a Summer Intern for CW3E, but my position has been extended to be a part-time one through the school year. Since joining CW3E in June, I've made a number of key contributions to the EnsDL codebase, including:
         <ul>
            <li>
               <b>Workflow standardization in NetCDF format</b>: NetCDF files are the data standard in meteorology, and I rewrote large sections of the workflow to use, parse, and export NetCDF files.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Code Efficiency Improvement</b>: I worked to find and address inefficiencies in the plotting algorithm, which ultimately led to a more than two-fold reduction in computation time. In particular, I wrote a subsetting algorithm to avoid recalculation of the Gamma CDF function for different regions of the overall grid. CW3E faces demand for daily plot outputs, and decreasing the computation time is a top priority to provide customers with data in a timely manner.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Numba JIT Compilation</b>: I pioneered the experimental use of Numba's JIT compilation library to induce further speedup in simple code (particularly, loop-heavy sections).
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Extending Multiprocessing Support</b>: By dividing plotting routines into smaller sections, I was able to achieve greater parallelism and, with large inputs, significant speedup.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Improving Plot Readability and Accessibility</b>: Using methods supported by the latest cognitive science research, I worked to streamline the plots produced by the EnsDL workflow. Of particular note is that I improved the color scheme to be more easily understandable as well as accessible to the colorblind. 
            </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
